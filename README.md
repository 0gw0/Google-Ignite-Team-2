# Google Ignite Team 2 - Healthy Fish App

Welcome to the Google Ignite Team 2's project, where we present the **Healthy Fish App** â€“ a fun and interactive way to promote good health and well-being, aligning with the UN Sustainable Development Goal 3.

## Introduction

In our app, you embark on a journey to improve your health while caring for your virtual fish. The core concept revolves around completing daily challenges to earn valuable "seashells," which can be used to upgrade and 'evolve' your fish into stronger and rarer species. Every player starts with a humble blue basic fish, and the goal is to nurture it into a magnificent, unique creature.
