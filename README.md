# Healthy Fish App
Our team built an app that aims to encourage good health and well-being (UN Sustainable Development Goal 3). The app encourages you to complete daily challenges and earn seashells. With seashells, you get to upgrade and 'evolve' your fish into a stronger and rarer one! Everyone starts the game with a blue basic fish.

The aim of the game is to complete as many daily challenges as possible to earn seashells which can be used as a currency to unlock rarer fish.

Daily challenges are all short tasks that are scientifically proven to improve health and well-being if done consistently. Examples include drinking sufficient water and practising meditation.

Join us in the pursuit of Good Health, Cool Fish!
